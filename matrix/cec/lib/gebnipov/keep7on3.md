We will be doing our **bi-weekly High Command** poll, where every member of the group can voice their concerns on ALL members C1+. This will **not **promote/demote anyone regardless of votes, this is done to gather community opinions. You may expect High Command Members to ask for a reason for disapprovals so prepare your DMs if needed.

You may use approving (✅ ), neutral (🟨  ), or disproving (❌ )

@everyone
