A lightweight, multi-language IDE designed for developers working with **FreeBASIC**, the **Wolfram Language**, and the **D Language**. Cavwyshed Studio aims to provide a fast, focused, and powerful editing experience.


<!-- TODO: Replace the above placeholder with a real screenshot of your IDE -->

## About The Project

Cavwyshed Studio was born from the need for a single, performant editor that understands the unique ecosystems of three powerful languages:

*   **FreeBASIC:** For fast, low-level, procedural programming with an easy-to-learn syntax.
*   **Wolfram Language:** For cutting-edge computational intelligence, symbolic programming, and data science.
*   **D Language:** For modern, high-performance systems programming that combines the power of C++ with the safety and productivity of modern languages.

This IDE is built *in* **FreeBASIC**, ensuring it remains lightweight and responsive, even on older hardware.

### Key Features

*   **Multi-Language Focus:** Dedicated support for FreeBASIC, Wolfram, and D syntax, project management, and build systems.
*   **Syntax Highlighting:** Rich, accurate, and customizable syntax highlighting for all supported languages.
*   **Integrated Build System:** Compile and run your FreeBASIC and D projects directly from the editor.
*   **Wolfram Kernel Integration:** Connect to a local Wolfram Engine to execute code and visualize results within the IDE.
*   **Project Management:** Simple project file structure to manage multi-file projects.
*   **Lightweight & Fast:** Written in FreeBASIC for minimal resource consumption and instant startup.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Aims for compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Supported Languages

Cavwyshed provides first-class support for the following languages:

### ðŸ”µ FreeBASIC

As the core language of the IDE itself, FreeBASIC support is robust.
- Seamless integration with the `fbc` compiler.
- Code completion for standard library functions.
- Built-in templates for common program types (e.g., console, graphics).
- Error parsing and highlighting in the editor.

### âš« Wolfram Language

Bridge the gap between systems programming and computational analysis.
- Syntax support for `.wls` and `.m` files.
- Execute selected code or entire files via a connection to the Wolfram Kernel.
- A dedicated panel to display symbolic output, plots, and graphics.
- Notebook-like cell evaluation for rapid prototyping.

### ðŸ”´ D Language

Harness the power of modern systems programming.
- Integration with `dmd`, `ldc`, and `gdc` compilers.
- Support for `dub` project files (`dub.json` / `dub.sdl`).
- Auto-completion suggestions based on project dependencies.
- Tools for easy navigation between modules.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You must have the compilers and/or interpreters for the languages you intend to use installed on your system.

*   **FreeBASIC Compiler (`fbc`)**
    ```sh
    # Follow instructions at: https://www.freebasic.net/
    ```

*   **D Compiler (`dmd`, `ldc`)**
    ```sh
    # Follow instructions at: https://dlang.org/download.html
    ```

*   **Wolfram Engine** (Optional, for Wolfram Language support)
    ```sh
    # Get the free engine for developers at: https://www.wolfram.com/engine/
    ```

### Installation & Building

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cavwyshed.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd cavwyshed
    ```
3.  Compile the project using FreeBASIC. (This example assumes the main source is `src/main.bas`)
    ```sh
    fbc src/main.bas -o cavwyshed
    ```
    *Note: A `Makefile` or build script may be provided for more complex builds.*

## Usage

Once compiled, you can run the editor from your terminal.

**Run the IDE:**
```sh
./cavwyshed
```

**Open a specific file:**
```sh
./cavwyshed path/to/your/file.bas
```

**Open a project directory:**
```sh
./cavwyshed /path/to/your/project_folder/
```
